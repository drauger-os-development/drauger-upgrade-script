You are about to attempt to upgrade your Drauger OS installation.
This process takes several minutes, and REQUIRES an internet connection.

Please be sure you are connected to the internet at this time.

Upgrading OS versions is inherently a risky procedure. $(BOLD)Any loss of data is entirely at the fault of the user. You have been warned.$(RESET)
Please take this time to ensure any important files are backed up to a separate drive such as a flash drive or external hard drive.

Once this process has started, it should not be stopped, and is irreversible without the usage of a tool such as BTRFS snapshots.
